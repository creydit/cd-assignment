# ðŸ”§ Custom LLVM Instruction: `SUPERADD5` for `i+++`

This project demonstrates how to design and integrate a custom instruction called `SUPERADD5` into the LLVM compiler backend (targeting x86) and try modify the C++ frontend (Clang) to support a custom operator syntax (`i+++`). The instruction adds 5 to a register directly and replaces typical `add i, 5` logic in the compiled assembly.

---

For a Compiler Design assignment, the goal was to:
- Define a new custom instruction (`SUPERADD5`)
- Modify LLVM backend to emit this instruction in place of `add i, 5`
- Optionally, allow a new C++ syntax `i+++` to invoke this behavior
- Generate and observe the custom instruction in final x86 assembly
